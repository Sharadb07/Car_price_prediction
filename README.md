# car_price_prediction
this project is my first project of machine learning.
it uses the vehicle dataset of kaggle link : "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho". 
I have designed the model to predict car price by taining the above dataset using machine learning algorithms.
Used pandas and seaborn for visualization.
Designed the model using randomforest algorith.
